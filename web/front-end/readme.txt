----------COMMIT: APRIL 13--------

HTML, CSS and JS front-end for the project website.

If hosting options are open, django is still great for larger more web application sites. However, if hosting space
is limited (and it looks like it might be) we can still have a strong presentation with a more static HTML-based
approach. 

Bootstrap (framework I used) is very compatible with django even though it's a javascript/css library.

I have a lot of scrap code locally as of 4/13 but am only committing the most updated and complete version.
